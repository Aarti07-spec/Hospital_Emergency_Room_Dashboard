# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
This Excel dashboard provides a visual analysis of emergency room data, including patient volume, wait times, satisfaction scores, gender and age distribution, admission status, and department referrals. Interactive slicers allow month and year selection for dynamic reporting.

# Features
Dynamic Monthly Selection – View data for any selected month using an interactive slicer. <br>
Patient Volume Metrics – Total number of patients attended in a given month.<br>
Average Wait Time – Real-time computation of patient waiting time.<br>
Patient Satisfaction Score – Aggregated satisfaction rating out of 5.<br>
Admission Breakdown – Number and percentage of admitted vs. non-admitted patients.<br>
Attendance Status – Pie chart showing delayed vs. on-time attendances.<br>
Gender-Based Analysis – Donut chart visualizing gender distribution of patients.<br>
Age Group Analysis – Bar chart showing patient count by age bracket.<br>
Referral Pattern – Visualization of patient referrals across different medical departments.<br>

## Key Insights Ex. from July Report

## Why This Project Stands Out
#### User-Friendly Design:
Clean and intuitive layout makes it easy for non-technical users to understand key ER metrics at a glance.<br>
#### Interactive Filtering:
Dynamic slicers for month and year enable real-time data exploration.<br>
#### Actionable Insights: 
Combines patient flow, satisfaction, and referral data to support decision-making and performance improvement.<br>
#### All-in-One View:
Consolidates multiple KPIs and visualizations into a single, scroll-free dashboard.<br>
#### Excel-Only Solution:
Built entirely in Excel—no external tools or coding required—making it accessible and easily customizable.<br>
